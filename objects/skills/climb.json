  "description": "The usefulness of the ability to clamber up things cannot be overstated. Most climbs should be single rolls though longer or more difficult climbs may require multiple rolls. On these climbs consider requiring a number or total or repeated failures to fall off unless it is a particularly merciless ascent. The GM should use their discretion.",
