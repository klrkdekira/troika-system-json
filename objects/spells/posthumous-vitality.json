The wizard rolls 2d6 plus their Posthumous Vitality Skill Total and consults the following chart (13+ counts for an Advancement tick): 4-12 Nothing happens. 13-14 The vitality is clumsily applied, causing the body to explode messily. A new one will need to be found. 15-16 The creature is animated and will last for 24 hours before literally falling to pieces. 17+ Perfect reanimation. The creature will last until destroyed.",
