Unfortunately your horse sped off into the pixie forest, or the court magician ensured you disappeared, or you led a sortie into the stars to put your stamp on them as well. Either way you are now a lost and lonely sovereign without a kingdom â€” no one has heard of you or your people. Most don't believe you and laugh, or worse, they do believe you and shrug at the vagaries of fate.",
