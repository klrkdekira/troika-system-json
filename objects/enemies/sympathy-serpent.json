  "description": "Dark, thick as a man's thigh, and as long as three destriers, they crush their prey as you'd expect such a snake to do but their hunting style is idiosyncratic: they do not wrestle with their quarry but offer a gentle embrace, telling them it's okay to let go, they're here now. Together prey and predator mourn the crushing awfulness of reality as one swallows the other whole.",
