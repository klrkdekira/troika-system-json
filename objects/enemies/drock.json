  "description": "Dwarfs are creatures of purpose; they set their minds on a course and follow it until they finish or run aground. Occasionally a Dwarf is forcibly prevented from finishing a project, possibly by dropping dead at an inopportune moment; it happens. Usually this is a sad but inconsequential occasion, but sometimes it happens while they pursue the highest art a Dwarf can engage in: creation of a new Dwarf. These creatures of raw surfaces, untreated stucco, brass armature, and soggy wet clay seek meaning, Dwarfiness, and to be finished by a sure and careful hand.",
