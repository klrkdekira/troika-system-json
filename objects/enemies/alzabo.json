  "description": "The red furred ghoul-bear, which at its shoulder stands as tall as a horse, would be a frightful creature for no other reason than its immediate physical impression. The Alzabo can produce — for it is not truly mimicking, rather recalling — the exact sound of any creature it has ever eaten. Crying out in the night, it draws its prey from safety, typically by imitating a recently eaten family member and calling to its children or parents.",
