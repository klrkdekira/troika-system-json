  "description": "The Ekodat is a series of crystalline protrusions emanating from a clouded crystal core. These \"tentacles\" don't move; instead they grow rapidly through the air like roots. Natural philosophers have been back and forth about the categorisation of the Ekodat. While all agree it is a chimera of mineral and some other substance they cannot confirm the matter of the other. The popular attitude is that it is a divine emanation caught and refracted in some unusually dense crystal matrix, causing what would otherwise be an angelic visitation to become a mineralogical hazard.",
