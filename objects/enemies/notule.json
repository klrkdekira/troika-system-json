By utilizing only the smallest bit of physical remains a knowledgeable sorcerer may set the creature hunting. It will fly by night until it reaches the intended victim, whereupon it will envelop them, suffocating and freezing their target all at once and leaving a relatively unmarked corpse before sluggishly returning home to enjoy its newfound warmth.",
