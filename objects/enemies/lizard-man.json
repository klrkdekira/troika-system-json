  "description": "Imagine a fat man but this man is a crocodile. Stand him on his hind legs, yank his head into a civilised position, shorten his snout, and give him some short horns and a large Weapon. This is a lizard-man, a preternaturally militaristic race who spontaneously regiment themselves from the moment they goose-step their way out of the egg. Their only social structure and interest is the army, making them excruciatingly dull dinner guests.",
