A witness to their intercrevice ambling would see a large, saggy-skinned humanoid with soulful grey eyes staggering as though carrying a heavy basin of water. The dolm never stops growing, as far as anyone can tell, and the oldest and wisest of their sort can tower above a typical townhouse while still being able to squeeze themselves under the door.",
