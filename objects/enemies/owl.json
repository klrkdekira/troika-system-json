  "description": "The rooftops of Troika are crenelated by owls. They watch the streets with dumb spite, waiting for a vole, a rat, or an errant, fat finger to come to their attention. They swoop after it, followed by other owls blindly responding to the motion. Together they descend like a rabid flock of razor sharp gulls blindly grasping. A perennial pest that the citizens of Troika are morbidly proud of tolerating.",
