  "description": "Parchment Witches are an unusual breed of living dead both for having usually chosen the state of their own volition and for their staunch denial of it. They cover their rotting skin in a layer of leather, vellum, or, if no other option is available, paper. They then paint it, decorate it, and top it with a wig, thus completing the illusion. The most talented can walk among us and we'd never know it. The only tell-tale signs of a Parchment Witch among you would be the distinct smell of leather rendering in the house next door and the disappearance of a few handsome townspeople.",
